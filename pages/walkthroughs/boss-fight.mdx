# Boss Fight/Final Level

Welcome to the final level of the game! 
fter a long and treacherous journey through the house, you have finally reached the climax of the game.
You will notice that you are placed on the same table from the kitchen level.
This is because we wanted it to seem like a seemless transition between the kitchen and boss fight while still switching screens.

Immediately things will begin to happen. Above you are two massive hands belonging to the human, who you can see in the background.
They will begin to move, and have different variations of what attacks they will be performing:

---

## Double Fist Smash

The double fist smash is probably the most important phase of the battle.
Whenever the two fists come down you will have a second to move out of the way before you take a heart of damage by getting hit.
If you are quick enough, you can move out of the way and avoid damage.
Now comes the important part.
You will want to face the fists while they are still on the ground and press the shoot button.
This will web the hand to the table, giving you a chance to jump on it like any other enemy in the game.
Each jump will take one-fifth of the human's health.

## One Hand Sweep (Left or Right)

This is one of two events in which you will want to use the jump points.
One of the humans hands will sweep across the table and you will not be able to jump over it.
This is a bit tricky since, due to the screen size, you will not be able to see which side it is initially coming from.
Make sure you get out of the way quickly to avoid taking a heart of damage!

## Two Hand Clap

This is the other event in which you will want to use the jump points.
Similar to the one hand sweep, you will not see the hands coming in initially.
However, with the two hand clap there will be a much better chance of survival in the middle.
The hands will close in until they clap together, and if you're not careful you will take a heart of damage.

With that knowledge, you can now proceed through the boss fight!
It may take a couple tries, but once you take away all of the human's health you have officially completed *Weaver's Wrath*!


Upon completion, a brief series of images will come up, showing the human's ultimate demise and your character along with their grandpa leaving the house.

Congratulations on finishing *Weaver's Wrath*! We sincerely hope you enjoyed our game and would give it an excellent review!
