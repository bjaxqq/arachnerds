# Weaver's Wrath
 
In shadows deep, the spider spun,\
A web so grand, its work begun,\
But in the quiet basement's gloom,\
A human came with sweeping broom.\
With careless hand, the web was torn,\
A fragile home now lost, forlorn.\
The spider crept, with quiet rage,\
Its tiny world swept off the stage.\
Now left to wander, small but proud,\
Its fury grows, a storm unbowed.\
The human who destroyed its lair,\
Shall feel the wrath from one so rare.\
With fangs and webs, the plan is set,\
Revenge shall come without regret.\
Through walls and cracks, the spider’s path,\
A tale unfolds — **Weaver's Wrath**.

Weaver's Wrath is is an adventure platform game, where you will play as a spider, taking revenge on the
human living in the home that destroyed the spider’s web. The environment of the game is
scaled to be very large in relation to the size of the spider, and the game has a fun and vibrant
art style. The spider has the ability to swing, web jump, shoot webs at enemy, and will travels
across multiple levels throughout the human's house, completing puzzles and defeating enemy bugs to complete the mission of revenge.

This website acts as the documentation website for the entire project, giving a better insight into the game's inner workings.
