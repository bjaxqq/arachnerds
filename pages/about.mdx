## The base game

Weaver's Wrath is actually an extension of a base game created by [Alex Thimineur](https://github.com/a-r-t) as a part of his SER225 class.
The course aims to introduce software development concepts such as group development and large-scale project work, and each student in the class is assigned a team
who choose either the Platformer or the RPG base game to expand upon.

With our group, we decided to go with the Platformer base game, something rather easily decided between the four of us.

## Our inspirations

Having chosen the platformer game, we then focused on developing a unique concept.
After running through several ideas, we landed on the idea of scaling the main character down to explore a large environment - a theme that aligns well with platformer gameplay.
Our inspiration came from the 2016 PlayStation exclusive *Unravel*, where the player controls a small, "apple-sized" character made of yarn, exploring human environments such as a garage or the beach that are much larger than the main character Yarny.

Obviously we couldn't take the game completely, but we thought the concept of having a large scale world with a small character would be really interesting to explore.
From there we had to choose the character and environment, and we eventually landed on a spider.
Spiders are obviously smaller animals, and the idea of a spider navigating through a human environment like a house came to us quickly after deciding on the spider.

The core mechanics were also inspired from *Unravel*, but since we were going to use a spider, we thought that some elements from *Spider-Man* would work well, such as the web shooting to disable and take down enemies.
